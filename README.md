# Data205 Capstone

## Datasets
This project will be using the HMDA public dataset, which can be found either at their website [cfpb.gov data browser](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/) or via their [data science kit](https://github.com/cfpb/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit)

## Project
In this project, I will analyze pricing differences between 2018 and 2023. In places with vast changes in pricing, I will look at the demographics that have been applying for loans before and after. This is intended to find places that have experienced gentrification and see if we can correlate it with certain changes, such as city construction.
